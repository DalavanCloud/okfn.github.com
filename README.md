## Open Knowledge Labs

Open Knowledge Labs is a place for folks to get together (online or IRL) to make stuff with data.  It acts as a hub for hacking, wrangling, analyzing, and prototyping for Open Knowledge Network, while also being a portal for technical work done at Open Knowledge International.

Labs is primarily volunteer-based with some support from Open Knowledge International

This repository is a Jekyll-based site for running <http://okfnlabs.org>.
