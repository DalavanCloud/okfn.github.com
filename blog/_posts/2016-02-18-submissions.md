 The first quarter of 2016 is almost through, which means that the OKFN Labs Newsletter is on its way! But we have a problem. We know that you have spent the last 3 months writing awesome code, founding disruptive new projects and basically changing the world. But we haven't received your newsletter submissions so we can help spread the word about what you've been up to. 
 
 Submitting your ideas or work for inclusion in the newsletter is easy, and only taks about a minute. Start by clicking the link for Open Knowledge Labs issue tracker [here](https://github.com/okfn/okfn.github.com/issues/new?title=[newsletter]).

 Here's what your submission should include:

 *A title that is succinct, and describes the item well
 *A link (or links) to the project/initiative you are submitting
 *A single paragraph that presents an introduction to the project/initiative

 And that's it! Its fast, its easy and it helps get the word out about your latest project - so submit your newsletter ideas today.
