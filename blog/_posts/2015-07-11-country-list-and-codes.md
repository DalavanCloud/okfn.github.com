title: "Featured Core Datasets: Comprehensive Country Codes and Country List"
---

Are you in need of a clean, well maintained list of all countries and
their associated international codes in CSV and JSON?  If so, you
might consider the
[country-codes](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-codes) and
[country-list](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-list) data
packages available at [data.okfn.org](http://data.okfn.org).

- **[Country Codes](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-codes)**,
  using source data from [ISO](http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm), the
  [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/),
  and others, provides comprehensive information for countries in the
  world, including their respective ISO 3166 codes, ITU dialing codes,
  ISO 4217 currency codes, and many others.

- **[Country List](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-list)**
  provides a subset of the information found in
  [country-codes](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-codes), for
  use when you only need a country's two-character ISO 3166 code and
  its name in English.

Often, different databases that provide country-level information may
use different unique identifiers for each country, adding significant
friction to the process of using the data they provide.  By linking
all standardized identifiers in one place,
[Country Codes](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-codes) can
provide a useful table on which to join distinct datasets and much
more.

## Core Datasets

![Data Package](http://assets.okfn.org/p/data/img/icon-128.png)

Due to the value they provide, these datasets have been designated
["core" datasets](http://data.okfn.org/roadmap/core-datasets) as part
of the part of the [Frictionless Data](/projects/frictionless-data/)
initiative.  The Core Datasets project is about collecting and
maintaining (curating) important and commonly-used datasets in a
high-quality, standardized, and easy-to-use form: in particular, as
up-to-date, well-structured
[Data Packages](http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/).  These
datasets are available now for inspection on the site, and are
downloadable in either CSV or JSON format for use in your next
application, website, or spreadsheet.

We need help suggesting, preparing and maintaining a set of "core"
datasets as Data Packages.  To get involved, see our previous
[call for data curators](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/01/03/data-curators-wanted-for-core-datasets.html).
