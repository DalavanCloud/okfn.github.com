Welcome to the second Labs Newsletter of 2015!  There has been
excellent progress on various open data tools and initiatives across
the Open Knowledge network since the last newsletter.  Let's take a
look:

## Labs Still <3 Discourse

Open Knowledge is in the process of centralizing community discussions
on our Discourse [forums](http://discuss.okfn.org).  In order to do
this, we've been enabling many new features to support
mailing-list-style communication such as starting and replying to new
topics via email.  There's already a lot of discussion there, so,
check out the
[Open Knowledge Labs](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-knowledge-labs)
category, sign up, and tell us about your favorite tools!

## JTS-SQL

Friedrich Lindenberg, AKA [pudo](http://okfnlabs.org/members/pudo/),
has booted up [JTS-SQL](https://github.com/okfn/jts-sql), a Python
library that removes some of the friction in dealing with data by
automatically generating database table models based on
[JSON Table Schema](http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/) field
descriptors.

## Give Me Text!

The Labs web service booted by
[Matt Fullerton](/members/mattfullerton/) for converting documents
(e.g. PDF) to text using OCR has been given a new name "Give Me Text!"
and [a nice URL](http://givemetext.okfnlabs.org/). Read the original
announcement
[here](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/02/21/documents-to-text.html).

## Core Data Curators

We're always looking for curators to help support our Core Datasets
project which is aimed at collecting and maintaining (curating)
important and commonly-used (“core”) datasets (e.g. GDP, ISO-codes) in
high-quality, standardized and easy-to-use form.  Interested in
joining?  Have questions?  Visit us
[here](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-knowledge-labs/core-datasets).

## OpenSpending Next

Work on the next iteration of
[OpenSpending](http://community.openspending.org/next) is picking up
steam.  We recently hosted an
[OpenSpending Tech Hangout](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/tech-hangout-sept-2015/1046/12)
to demo some of our recent work.  We can't do it without you, so jump
into the
[OpenSpending category](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/openspending) and
tell us how you'd like your government's finances aggregated, stored,
and visualized :).

## Building a 100% Open-Source-based Open Data platform

Alex Corbi
[shares his experience](http://www.open-steps.org/my-experience-building-a-100-open-source-based-open-data-platform/)
participating in the development of the
[Open Development Mekong](http://www.opendevelopmentmekong.net)
project, a platform built using 100% open-source technologies whose
aim is to increase transparency in the South Asian countries of the
Mekong basin region. The article focuses on its main component; a
knowledge base platform built using
[CKAN](http://ckan.org/). Additionally, Alex gives an overview on how
the development was coordinated on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and
the set of additional tools developed around the project, including a
[plugin to connect Wordpress and CKAN](http://extensions.ckan.org/extension/wpckan/),
which can be used and re-purposed for future projects the attendees
can find themselves in the future.

## Open Data Companion

Osahon Okungbowa let us know about a mobile app he has created,
[Open Data Companion (ODC)](http://odc.utopiasoftwareonline.com/),
which provides a unified access point to over 120 CKAN open data
portals and thousands of datasets from around the world, right from
your mobile device. Crafted with mobile-optimised features and design,
this is an easy and convenient way to find, access and share open
data.

## Mexico's new Open Data Portal

Juan Ortiz Freuler has pointed us to
[this report](https://es.scribd.com/doc/274622757/Supply-and-Demand-of-Data-Through-Mexico-s-Open-Data-Portal),
written in non-technical language, which provides the reader with
contextual data to understand the challenges the government of a
developing country is facing in the implementation of an Open Data
Portal. The report includes analysis of availability and quality of
key datasets, critical analysis of the existing normative framework,
an analysis of web traffic towards the portal, as well as insights
from interviews with over two dozen professional Mexican data users.

## A Model for Frictionless Science?

Steven De Costa has been doing work with open government data for the
last few years, mostly around the platform capability of CKAN, and has
been considering what frictionless science might look like:

> I've been thinking about how to publish the full set of research
> artifacts needed to replicate and review work undertaken by labs, or
> to swap out data and reconstitute the research in a new context. That
> thinking, done only with little access to end users, has revealed the
> following short list of what might be published as a 'dataset' listing
> of 'resources'...
