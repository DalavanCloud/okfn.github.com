## Give Me Text!

In a [previous post](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/02/21/documents-to-text.html), I detailed a web service where you can throw documents of many kinds at it, and get text in return. We've now given this service a name, "Give Me Text!", and a nice URL at [http://givemetext.okfnlabs.org/](http://givemetext.okfnlabs.org/) for both the API, which is at a subpath [/tika](http://givemetext.okfnlabs.org/tika) and a web interface for uploading documents to the service. The web service is based on [some nice work by Tyler Palsulich](https://github.com/tpalsulich/TikaExamples/tree/gh-pages) who got in touch via [GitHub](https://github.com/okfn/ideas/issues/88#issuecomment-100107044). Thanks Tyler!
