title: Case Studies for Frictionless Data
---

For our [Frictionless Data](http://frictionlessdata.io/) project, we
were curious to learn about some of the common issues users face when
working with data.  To that end, we started a
[Case Study series](http://frictionlessdata.io/case-studies/) to
highlight projects and organizations working with the Frictionless
Data specifications and tooling in interesting and innovative ways.

Through several interviews over the past several months, we now have
three case studies published on a range of topics: data science in the
browser, the provision of clean power system data for energy
researchers, and re-usable components for cloud-based data-intensive
workflows.

## Dataship

<http://frictionlessdata.io/case-studies/dataship/>

We interviewed Waylon Finn of [Dataship](https://dataship.io/) to
learn more about how he uses the Data Package specifications.
Dataship is a way to share data and analysis, from simple charts to
complex machine learning, with anyone in the world easily and for
free.  The
[Data Package](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) acts
as the base format for Dataship notebooks.

### Open Power System Data

<http://frictionlessdata.io/case-studies/open-power-system-data/>

We spoke to Lion Hirth and Ingmar Schlecht about
[Open Power System Data](http://open-power-system-data.org/), a
free-of-charge and open platform providing clean, high quality data
needed for power system analysis and modeling.  The project is aimed
at resolving some of the most common, persistent issues energy
researchers face when working with data.

## Tesera

<http://frictionlessdata.io/case-studies/tesera/>

Spencer Cox of [Tesera Systems, Inc.](http://tesera.com) shared how
his team is using the
[Frictionless Data specifications](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/)
across a range of purpose-built tools to power data-driven
applications in the cloud.

## Reach out to us

If you are using any of the Frictionless Data
specifications---[JSON Table Schema](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/),
[Data Packages](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/)---for
your project, big or small, reach out to us.  We can work together on
developing a case study to share your project with the world!
