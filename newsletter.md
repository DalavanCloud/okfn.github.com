# Labs Newsletter

The [Open Knowledge Labs](http://okfnlabs.org) newsletter is published approx. every quarter, providing coverage on new and interesting data and tech initiatives from Open Knowledge and the wider Open Knowledge network.

## How to submit an item for inclusion

Submitting an item for inclusion in the newsletter is easy! Open a new issue on the Open Knowledge Labs issue tracker [here](https://github.com/okfn/okfn.github.com/issues/new?title=[newsletter]).

A good submission will help us get the newsletter organized efficiently, and would ideally include:

* A title that is succinct, and describes the item well
* A link (or links) to the project/initiative you are submitting
* A single paragraph that presents an introduction to the project/initiative

You'll be updated as to the inclusion of the submission in the newsletter via the same issue.
