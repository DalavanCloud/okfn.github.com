Paul is a full-stack developer who delights in the possibilities of social and personal empowerment through open data. He sees technology as a *means* to this end, and finds his education in anthropology and sociology always relevant when working on open data projects. Skills include Python, Javascript, UX, and just enough DevOps to be dangerous.
