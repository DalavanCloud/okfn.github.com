Lexman is the software architect from [Mappy](http://www.mappy.com) convinced by the power of data.
He thinks we can apply to data the same methods for working in group that have succeded in software development, like continuous integration. Therefore he created [tuttle](https://github.com/lexman/tuttle) for working on open data.
