Dan recently completed an [MSc in ICT for
Development](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/geography/coursefinder/mscpgdippsdict4d.aspx)
from Royal Holloway, University of London.  It exposed him to, among
other things, the significant challenges and possibilities inherent in
the use of open data for human development.  Outside of academic
research, he has experience in system administration and web
development.
