After being involved in research (video decompression for people with visual-impairment, driving simulation for night-driving difficulties and traffic modelling) for almost 10 years, Matt now works on web development, data analysis and visualisation, currently for <a href="http://www.smartlane.de/">SMARTLANE</a>. He loves open data and am excited by the plethora of tools its increase has inspired.
