BibServer is an open-source RESTful bibliographic data
server. BibServer makes it easy to create and manage collections of
bibliographic records such as reading lists, publication lists and
even complete library catalogs.  [FacetView](/projects/facetview/) is
included to provide a rich interface for complex search queries.
BibServer supports [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/),
[MARC](http://www.loc.gov/marc/),
[RIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_%28file_format%29),
[BibJSON](/projects/bibjson/), [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) and other
bibliographic formats.
