title: Bad Data
---

Bad Data is a site detailing real-world examples of how **not** to
prepare or provide data. It showcases poorly structured, misformatted,
or just plain ugly datasets and what they get wrong.

While its primary purpose is to serve as an educational tool for
governments and other organizations, it is also a good source of
practice material for budding data wranglers---those tasked with
cleaning and transforming data.  The project began as a place to keep
practice data for [Data Explorer](/projects/data-explorer/), another
project of Open Knowledge Labs.
