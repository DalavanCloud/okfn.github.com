WikipediaJS is a simple JS library for accessing information in Wikipedia articles such as dates, places, abstracts etc.

The library is the work of Labs member Rufus Pollock. In essence, it is a small wrapper around the data and APIs of the DBPedia project and it is they who have done all the heavy lifting of extracting structured data from Wikipedia - huge credit and thanks to DBPedia folks!
