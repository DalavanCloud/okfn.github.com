PublicBodies.org is a website hosting a database of so-called *public
bodies*---that is government-run or -controlled organizations (which
may or may not have a distinct corporate existence). Examples include
government ministries or departments, as well as state-run
organizations such as libraries, police and fire departments.

Contributions of additional data and better descriptions for new and
existing jurisdictions are very welcome.  Please add a CSV file [via a
pull request](https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies#contribute-data) or
take a look project's [issue queue](https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies/issues).
